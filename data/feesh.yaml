notes:
  - All aquaponic systems are ran as constant flood using a simple standpipe (search "Ebb and Flow Fitting Kit"). After much experimentation, I came to the conclusion that dealing with bell siphons or additional timers is not worth the effort, flood risk, or the extra wear on the pump.

  - The goldies, endlers, and flowerhorn use LECA as a grow media, and the congo biotope uses Growstones (now defunct).

  - With the exception of the endlers, all aquaponic systems have a 30PPI mattenfilter serving as a prefilter for the pump.

  - \"Cheap\" lighting (Beamworks, Nicrew, generic LED shop lights) is used for all aquarium lighting.

  - Non-aquaponic systems recieve 20-30% water changes on a weekly basis using treated tap water.

  - Aquaponic systems are tested weekly and recieve a 20-30% water change when necessary.

  - Soft-water tanks recieve an RO/tap mix, with wastewater being used in the others. If there is not enough wastewater to complete water changes/top offs, tap + SeaChem Equilibrium is used instead.

  - Excluding the Congo biotope, all aquaponic systems have crushed coral to assist in maintaining mineral content.

  - Aquaponic systems which grow food plants recieve doses of liquid kelp as needed as determined by plants. Typical dosing is 2x weekly at 1oz/10G.

  - Non-food systems recieve twice weekly doses of Seachem Flourish, and daily doses of Seachem Excel. When establishing new plants Seachem Flourish Advanced is dosed daily until new growth appears. Doses are applied at labeled rates.

  - Everything is always in flux, and nothing here is a hard rule. A lot is played by ear and is learned through experience.
